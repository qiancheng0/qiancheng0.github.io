This is Cheng Qian's personal [homepage](https://qiancheng0.github.io/).

## A short introduction
I am currently a undergraduate student studying at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am a member of THUNLP, advised by Prof. Zhiyuan Liu. I have broad interests in natural language processing, with a focus on pre-trained language models, parameter & data efficient tuning, and tool learning & tool creation.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher. 
* Strong interpersonal skills with a good sense of teamwork.
* Programming Skills: Python, C/C++.
* Rich experience in state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
